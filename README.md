## About Basic Tech

**Basic Tech** is a modern software development and IT consulting company that builds web, mobile, backend, and AI-powered products for startups and growing businesses. We're not an agency. We're a team of elite engineers who understand systems, not just frameworks.

### Our Philosophy

**Software doesn't need more people. It needs better ones.**

**AI doesn't replace engineers. It amplifies the best ones.**

We believe modern software development is about fundamentals, clarity, and leverage — not bloated teams or unnecessary complexity.

## How We Build

A clear, engineering-led software development process designed for speed, quality, and precision.

1. **Understand the Problem** - We don't write a single line of code until we fully understand the business problem and its real-world impact.

2. **Design the System** - Architecture first. Data flows, API contracts, and component hierarchies are mapped before execution.

3. **Build with AI Leverage** - AI tooling accelerates scaffolding so engineers focus on complex logic and product decisions.

4. **Test & Refine** - Automated testing pipelines and rigorous reviews ensure stable, production-ready software.

5. **Ship & Support** - Reliable deployment pipelines, monitoring, and long-term support keep systems healthy at scale.
